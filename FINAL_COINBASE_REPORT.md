## Correlation Analysis

### Pearson Correlation
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Limited by single funding rate record
- **P-value**: Insufficient data for statistical significance
- **Interpretation**: Real data collection limited correlation analysis

### Spearman Correlation
- **Correlation Coefficient**: Limited by single funding rate record
- **P-value**: Insufficient data for statistical significance
- **Interpretation**: Real data collection limited correlation analysis

### T-Test Results
- **Test**: Insufficient data for meaningful t-test
- **Result**: Single funding rate record limits statistical testing
- **Interpretation**: Extended data collection needed for robust analysis

## Yield Modeling and Sensitivity Analysis

### Base Yield Calculation
```
Annualized Yield = Average Funding Rate × 3 × 365
Annualized Yield = -0.000018% × 3 × 365 = -0.020% annually
```

### Notional Sensitivity Results (Real Data)

| Notional Amount | Base Yield | Adjusted Yield | Haircut Factor | Market Impact |
|----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| $100M | -$20,228 | -$1,011 | 5.00% | 10.00% |
| $250M | -$50,570 | -$2,529 | 5.00% | 11.99% |
| $500M | -$101,141 | -$5,057 | 5.00% | 13.49% |
| $750M | -$151,711 | -$7,586 | 5.00% | 14.38% |
| $1B | -$202,282 | -$10,114 | 5.00% | 15.00% |
