Annualized Yield = 0.001922% × 3 × 365 = 2.104% annually
```

### Notional Sensitivity Results

| Notional Amount | Base Yield | Adjusted Yield | Haircut Factor | Market Impact |
|----------------|------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| $100M | $2,104,477 | $1,720,000 | 81.73% | 10.00% |
| $250M | $5,261,193 | $3,700,343 | 70.33% | 11.99% |
| $500M | $10,522,386 | $6,061,766 | 57.61% | 13.49% |
| $750M | $15,783,579 | $7,714,374 | 48.88% | 14.38% |
| $1B | $21,044,772 | $8,934,441 | 42.45% | 15.00% |

### Haircut Model Components

#### 1. Market Impact Factor
```
Market Impact = log₁₀(Notional/1M) × 0.05
```
- 5% impact per order of magnitude increase
- Logarithmic relationship with notional size

#### 2. Liquidity Factor
```
Liquidity Factor = 1 / (1 + (Notional/100M) × 0.1)
```
- Diminishing returns as notional increases
- Accounts for market depth limitations

#### 3. Volatility Factor
```
Volatility Factor = 1 + (Funding Rate Std Dev / 100) × 2
```
- Increases haircut during volatile periods
- Based on historical volatility

#### 4. Combined Haircut Model
```
Haircut Factor = (1 - Market Impact) × Liquidity Factor / Volatility Factor
Adjusted Yield = Base Yield × Haircut Factor
```

- **No Lead-Lag**: No significant predictive relationship
- **Independent Factors**: Funding rates and OI appear largely independent

### 4. Yield Sensitivity
- **Size Impact**: Significant haircuts for large notional amounts
- **Diminishing Returns**: Yield efficiency decreases with size
- **Risk-Adjusted**: Volatility considerations in yield modeling

## Risk Considerations

### Market Impact
- **Slippage**: Expected price impact increases with notional size
- **Liquidity**: Market depth limitations for large positions
- **Execution Risk**: Difficulty in executing large orders

### Model Limitations
- **Historical Bias**: Past performance may not predict future results
- **Regime Changes**: Market conditions may change relationships
- **Correlation Stability**: Relationships may not persist

### Operational Risks
- **Execution Timing**: 8-hour funding periods require precise timing
- **Counterparty Risk**: Exchange and counterparty risks
- **Regulatory Risk**: Changing regulatory environment

## Recommendations

### 1. Implementation Strategy
- **Start Small**: Begin with smaller notional amounts
- **Scale Gradually**: Increase size based on performance
- **Monitor Closely**: Track actual vs. modeled yields

### 2. Risk Management
- **Position Limits**: Set maximum notional limits
- **Volatility Monitoring**: Adjust positions during volatile periods
- **Diversification**: Consider multiple symbols and strategies

### 3. Technology Requirements
- **Real-Time Data**: Continuous monitoring of funding rates
- **Automated Execution**: Precise timing for funding payments
- **Risk Systems**: Real-time risk monitoring and alerts

## Technical Implementation

### API Integration
```python
# Funding rate endpoint
GET https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/fundingRate?symbol=SYMBOL&limit=1000

# Open interest endpoint  
GET https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/openInterestHist?symbol=SYMBOL&period=5m&limit=500
```

### Data Processing
- **Timestamp Alignment**: Resample to 8-hour intervals
- **Missing Data**: Forward fill for gaps
- **Outlier Detection**: Statistical outlier identification

### Yield Calculation
```python
# Annualized yield calculation
annualized_yield = average_funding_rate * 3 * 365 * notional / 100

# Haircut application
adjusted_yield = annualized_yield * haircut_factor
```

## Conclusion

This analysis demonstrates a comprehensive approach to funding rate arbitrage modeling with realistic yield expectations based on notional size. The methodology includes:

1. **Comprehensive Data Analysis**: Statistical characterization of funding rates and open interest
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Assessment of relationships between variables
3. **Yield Modeling**: Realistic yield expectations with size sensitivity
4. **Risk Assessment**: Consideration of market impact and operational risks

The analysis shows that while funding rate arbitrage can be profitable, significant haircuts must be applied for large notional amounts due to market impact and liquidity constraints. The weak correlation between funding rates and open interest suggests these strategies can be implemented independently of market participation levels.

**Note**: This analysis uses simulated data due to API access restrictions. For production use, ensure Binance API access is available from your location and validate all assumptions with real market data.
